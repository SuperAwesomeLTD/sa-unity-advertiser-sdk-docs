Measure installs
================

The Unity Advertiser SDK contains a submodule that allows you to measure installs generated by CPI (Cost per Install) campaigns.

Once you've done that you'll need to call the **handleInstall** method, preferably in the first scene presented to the user.

.. code-block:: c#

    using tv.superawesome.sdk.advertiser;

    public class MainScript : MonoBehaviour {

        void Start () {

          SAVerifyInstall.getInstance ().handleInstall ((success) => {
            // handle callback
          });
        }

        // Update is called once per frame
        void Update () {
            // ...
        }
    }

The method will only run once per application lifecycle, usually when the application is first installed on a user's phone.

It also contains a simple callback with a boolean **success** parameter that lets you know if AwesomeAds considered this
install as having been generated by a CPI campaign.

.. warning:: Please be aware that not implementing this method at all will mean you won't be able to measure installs coming from
             AwesomeAds CPI campaigns, at all.
